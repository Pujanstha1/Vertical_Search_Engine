,numerous factors associated with increased decreased alzheimer’s disease risk a new study indicates lean muscle mass may play a preventive role in disease onset however reasons why muscle mass influences alzheimer’s remain unclear more research needed to investigate relationship its mechanisms experts have long recommended regular exercise as a potential approach to help reduce risk of alzheimer’s disease now new research published in british medical journal supports this thinking — suggesting that developing lean muscle might offer a level of protection against neurological condition university of california san francisco scientists found that individuals with higher lifelong levels of lean muscle mass had a reduction in alzheimer’s risk previous studies have explored role of obesity body mass index bmi in alzheimer’s development however these “did not find evidence for a causal effect” said dr iyas daghlas a thirdyear neurology resident at university of california san francisco coauthor of study uncertain whether bmi alone was a significant enough determinant of alzheimer’s risk researchers wanted to explore body composition more closely “we hypothesized that disaggregating body mass into lean mass fat mass could reveal novel associations with disease” daghlas told healthline what study involved researchers used data from hundreds of thousands of individuals largest group of which came from uk biobank — an ongoing database collecting half a million individuals’ health genetic information data was studied by employing mendelian randomization which uses gene variations as proxies for certain risk factors further bioimpedance measures — an electrical current that runs through body at various speeds depending on muscle fat composition — were used to estimate individuals’ lean muscle fat mass a total of genetic variants were linked to lean muscle mass none of which were found in area of brain associated with vulnerability to alzheimer’s on average participants with greater levels of genetically proxied lean muscle had a statistically significant lower risk of developing disease to affirm these findings researchers repeated analytical process using data from a further individuals of which had an alzheimer’s diagnosis rather than in legs arms they measured lean muscle mass in trunk whole body again they found that greater lean muscle was associated with reduced chances of developing alzheimer’s one result was somewhat unexpected while body fat was linked to poorer performance on cognitive tasks once adjusted for lean mass analysis did not find a link between body fat alzheimer’s risk “i was surprised by striking discordance between protective effect of lean mass on dementia risk absence of an effect of fat mass on dementia risk” stated daghlas what findings didn’t tell us while findings support a causeandeffect association between muscle mass alzheimer’s risk some unanswered questions remain for instance it unclear whether lean muscle has to be “built” before a certain age to positively influence alzheimer’s development if it only impacts certain alzheimer’s pathologies further “this study does not directly address question of whether factors behind dna — such as proactively building muscle mass — benefits from association” said dr anna nordvig a neurologist at newyorkpresbyterian weill cornell medicine who was not associated with research it’s also unknown whether those with mild signs of alzheimer’s cognitive impairment would experience symptom regression after building lean muscle that said “this study supports current recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent dementia” asserted daghlas “it a hopeful finding which gives patients agency in their neurologic health”,Health
,another limitation of study that mechanisms behind relationship between lean muscle alzheimer’s remain unclear researchers briefly speculated on potential links for instance cardiovascular disease has long been affiliated with alzheimer’s although daghlas noted association “complicated” vascular dementia driven by heart disease concerns such as stroke hypertension daghlas said “in contrast most recent causal evidence suggests weaker evidence for an effect of vascular risk factors on alzheimer’s disease risk” he explained — “though this a controversial notion” while further exploration required “it may very well be case that lean mass reduces risk of vascular dementia via a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk” daghlas said “this can be investigated in future studies” researchers also speculated in paper that “new” mechanisms may be at play — such as circulating centrally acting myokines “myokines proteins released by muscles that affect other tissues” daghlas revealed “they have been shown in experimental studies to be induced by exercise to positively influence brain function” aside from these other musclerelated factors “may explain larger picture” said dr anna nordvig a neurologist at newyorkpresbyterian weill cornell medicine who was not associated with research for instance “bone hormones cardio vs strength training differences sex hormones glymphatic drainage depending on exercise sleep to name a few” ultimately more clinical intervention studies needed to confirm effect of lean muscle on alzheimer’s drivers behind relationship steps to reduce your risk of alzheimer’s while there’s no foolproof measure to prevent alzheimer’s experts believe various measures can aid in reducing your risk profile these fall into two categories said nordvig “protect” “stimulate” — “physical activity falls into both of these” “‘protect’ includes keeping an eye on things we discuss at a yearly physical” she explained — such as blood pressure sugar levels weight diet sleep there environmental risk factors linked to alzheimer’s that we should also aim to protect ourselves from said dr rena sukhdeo singh a vascular neurologist with university of maryland shore regional health fine particulate matter in air pollution has also been linkedtrusted source to increased dementia risk systemic inflammation another factor associated with alzheimer’s onset sukhdeo singh said chronic inflammation can occur for many reasons ranging from medications to high sugar processed food intake to smoking excessive alcohol consumption meanwhile “stimulate” involves optimizing other daily inputs that impact cognition for instance “learning a new skill hobby language instrument” suggested sukhdeo singh engaging in shorter activities like “sudokus puzzles number games” unfortunately we’re unable to influence some elements “nonmodifiable risk factors include age genetics sex” she added how to build lean muscle increasing your lean muscle mass simpler than you might think said rachel lovitt certified personal trainer founder of mindful movement living it involves “challenging your muscles to do more than they normally do recovering from that challenge providing your muscles proper fuel to both meet recover from that challenge” she told healthline building lean muscle doesn’t have to involve lifting heavy weights “resistance training strength training any form of movement that uses resistance external loads to challenge your muscle” lovitt said numerous weighted objects can be used from dumbbells kettlebells to resistance bands water bottles even your own body weight can be enough she added when it comes to moves lovitt recommended engaging in weighted actions that simultaneously target multiple areas so you train your whole body for instance squats a great option for lower body as they “work so many muscle groups at once one of most functional exercises out there” she stated to target upper body moves to try include pushups shoulder presses rows american college of sports medicine acsm statestrusted source you should strength train times per week “increase your resistance by once you can perform repetitions past your goal” said lovitt “the acsm recommends that novice healthy resistance trainers do sets per exercise doing reps at of one repetition max” she added but exercise only one piece of lean muscle picture “properly fueling your exercise vital to increasing muscle mass” lovitt stated this means “eating enough protein so your muscle has building blocks to grow” she said ensuring your diet includes a good balance of micronutrients macronutrients so your body can function properly proper recovery also essential “muscles aren’t built in gym they’re built in your sleep” said lovitt “exercise stimulus that provokes muscle growth but rest when your muscles actually grow” all of this can feel a little overwhelming exercises that work for one individual might not be so suited to another “when it comes to increasing muscle mass i highly recommend working with a qualified personal trainer movement specialist so that you can come up with a plan that works for your unique life

most needed to capitalise he failed ifs buts fine margins all that how he would love not to have to be making such empty reflections but thats story with rory all too frequently these days a player capable of winning everything else other than competitions that mean most yet putting himself in mix at those events more than any other player in game my last seven major championships ive finished
